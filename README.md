<h2 align="Left">Overview</h2>
<p>Telangana is one of major state of India. It is the 10th largest state in terms of GDP(Gross Domestic Product) in India and 12th most populous state as per 2011 census. Telangana consist of 33 districts, Ranga Reddy, Hyderabad, Mulugu are some of the major districts here. So, we can get an idea that analysing the growth of such state would be a challenging task.That is why I chose this data for analysis.
</p>
<p>Under the act of OpenData policy, Telangana government published their revenue, investements and other demographic data to the public. So, I had analysed this data and build a Power BI dashboard showcasing the number of stamps they sold, total revenue they created out of those sold stamps across different districts, how much investment was subjected into different sectors, number of vehicles and types of vehicles sold though out the years and many more KPIs
